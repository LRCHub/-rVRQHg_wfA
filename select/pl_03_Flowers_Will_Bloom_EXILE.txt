My heart goes out to you
When the winter snows give way
to spring
My heart is longing now
Longing for the town
where the happiness had been
Been a place of hope
and of dreaming too,
Been a home when my heart
always went back to you,
But for now I only dream
Of the people
who I loved and knew.
Someone is singing I can hear
singing now
Someone is weeping I can feel
their tears
Someone is smiling showing me
why and how to
go on living for years and years
Flowers will bloom,
yes they will yes they will
For you who are here
or yet to be born.
They'll bloom, yes they will
and they bloom again until
There's no missing sorrow
and no reason left to mourn
My heart goes out to you
When the morning sun lights
up the pale blue sky
My heart is heavy now
With the grief I tried so often
to deny
I regret mistakes
that I sometimes made
But I know our love
will never fade
And that you'll live on
instead of me
And that you will have
whatever love can be.
Someone is thinking I can read
every thought
Someone is shedding
tears for all that was lost
Someone is leading you to love
that they sought
asking you to love all that you
love the most.
Flowers will bloom,
yes they will yes they will
For you who are here
or yet to be born.
They'll bloom, yes they will
and they bloom again until
There's no missing sorrow
and no reason left to mourn.
Flowers will bloom,
yes they will yes they will
For you who are here
or yet to be born.
They'll bloom, yes they will
and they bloom again until
There's no missing sorrow
and no reason left to mourn
Yes they will
They'll bloom yes they will
and they bloom again until...
You'll live and remember
and love us forever more
